# charge-port-opener
weak attempt at making a little thing that I can press that will open the charge port on my Tesla Model 3 based on what I can find online

## References used so far:

Starting with CircuitPython and adafruit pre-assembled thing cause I'm lazy:

## hardware setup so far:
* single one of these to run the code: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3177
* stranded wire 1/4 wave antenna at 29cm long (315MHz supposedly) soldered to ANT throughhole
